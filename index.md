### Microscopia and the world of yeasts.

We are currently building microscopes that works with a smartphones. When you take a photo of a microscopic cell you are pretty much alone in your experiement, sharing and comparing it to other people with same interest would bring more openess to fermented matter, Building an autonomous platform for data collection of wine/beer/sourdough/kimshy/kefir/kombucha makers would largely help loads of fermented experiements. Allready many facebook groups gather many amateurs around these questions, but it's limited when it comes to read a microscopic bacteria, yeast, cell etc...

What if we could collectively share, depending on seasons and phenotypes the organoleptic datas about our own ''terroir experiment'' being able to compare with one an other about the state of fermentation by simply taking a photo of what's alive in the ''bioreactor'' and make the best decision on how much nutrient or acidity or oxygen must be added, 


imagine feeding algaes soon:
