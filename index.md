### Microscopia and the world of yeats.

We are currently building microscops that works with a smartphone. It would be autonomous platform based data collection of wine/beer/sourdough/kimshy/kefir/kombucha makers, we know for certain that most of fermented matter in the wine world goes to a lab without knowing how to read how yeasts behave and express their specific gene phenotypes. 

What if we could collectively share, depending on seasons, phenotypes, organolepsy the datas about our own terroir, being able to compare with one an other about the state of fermentation by simply taking a photo of what's alive in the ''bioreactor''

So we do not depend on a private expensive Lab and know precisly waht is going on.
